# Continuous-in-time representation of evoked potentials

## Abstract

In the signal decoding tasks, we work with multidimensional time series, which are a
discretization of a continuous process. The latest works in neural ODE illustrate the
possibility to work with recurrent neural networks as with differential equations.

This work addresses such applications as change of sampling rate and handling missed or
irregular data. It becomes possible if we represent our signal as a continuous in time
function. This approach is relevant for signals from various wearable devices:
accelerometers, heart rate monitors, devices for picking up brain signals such as
electroencephalograms or electrocorticograms.

The main result of this work is a comparison of convolutional and differential approaches 
to solving P300-paradigm signal decoding task while having regular and irregular time series.
